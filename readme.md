# List of Friends ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
You are going to create a program that asks the user to enter in a list of friends. The user might enter one name or one hundred names, your code should work for any amount of friends.

Once the user is done entering friends, you will then display the list of friends back to them, in the order that they were put in. You will then randomly choose two friends from the list (each friend has an equal chance at being chosen and no friend can be chosen twice) to go to the movies with you.

You will then ask the user which of their friends from the list above, they would like to add to their "Best Friends List". The user might enter one name or all the names in their friend list, your code should work for any amount. You will then remove those names from the friend list add them to the best friend list.

Here is an example of the program running:
```text
Welcome! Please enter your friends' first name. Press "d" when you are done.
